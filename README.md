# CDR-IPDR-Tower Intelligence Platform

A comprehensive LangChain-based intelligence platform for analyzing Call Detail Records (CDRs), Internet Protocol Detail Records (IPDRs), and Tower Dump data to detect criminal patterns and generate actionable intelligence reports.

## ðŸš€ New: Tower Dump Analysis Integration

The platform now includes full Tower Dump analysis capabilities, enabling law enforcement to:
- Identify all devices present at crime scenes
- Track movement patterns and trajectories
- Detect device identity changes (IMEI/IMSI swapping)
- Cross-reference physical presence with communication data
- Build comprehensive suspect profiles

## Features

### CDR Analysis
- **Multi-Pattern Detection**: Device switching, temporal patterns, communication behavior
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated suspect ranking with color-coded risk levels
- **Network Analysis**: Identifies connections and criminal network structures
- **Natural Language Interface**: Query CDR data using plain English

### IPDR Analysis
- **Encryption Detection**: Identifies usage of encrypted apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal)
- **Data Pattern Analysis**: Unusual data usage patterns and volumes
- **Session Behavior**: Connection timing and duration analysis
- **App Fingerprinting**: Identifies specific applications used

### Tower Dump Analysis
- **Crime Scene Presence**: Identify all devices at specific locations and times
- **Movement Tracking**: Analyze device trajectories and speed patterns
- **Device Identity**: Track IMEI/IMSI changes and SIM swapping
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Detect one-time visitors, frequent visitors, reconnaissance
- **Geofencing**: Define and analyze geographic boundaries

### Integrated Intelligence
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Link tower presence with CDR/IPDR activity
- **Silent Device Detection**: Find devices present but not communicating
- **Evidence Chains**: Build connections between physical presence and digital activity
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Unified intelligence reports from all data sources

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd cdr_intelligence_agent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenRouter API key
```

## Usage

### 1. Integrated Analysis (Recommended)
Analyze CDR, IPDR, and Tower Dump data together:

```bash
python test_integrated_tower_dump.py
```

Or use the enhanced integrated agent directly:

```python
from integrated_agent.integrated_agent_v2 import EnhancedIntegratedAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = EnhancedIntegratedAgent(api_key="your-api-key")

# Load all data sources
agent.load_all_data(
    cdr_files=["cdr1.xlsx", "cdr2.xlsx"],
    ipdr_files=["ipdr1.xlsx", "ipdr2.xlsx"],
    tower_dump_files=["tower_dump1.csv"]
)

# Analyze crime scene
result = agent.analyze_crime_scene(
    crime_location="Bank of India, MG Road",
    crime_time="2024-01-15 14:30:00",
    radius_km=1.0
)
```

### 2. CDR Analysis
Analyze CDR files and generate intelligence report:
```bash
python main.py analyze
```

Analyze specific files:
```bash
python main.py analyze -f "9042720423_Ali.xlsx,9391251134_Peer basha.xlsx"
```

### 3. IPDR Analysis
Run IPDR analysis interactively:
```bash
python ipdr_interactive.py
```

### 4. Tower Dump Analysis
Use the tower dump agent for specific analysis:

```python
from tower_dump_agent import TowerDumpAgent

agent = TowerDumpAgent(api_key="your-api-key")
agent.load_tower_dump("tower_dump.csv")

# Analyze crime scene
result = agent.analyze_crime_scene(
    crime_time="2024-01-15 14:30:00",
    duration_hours=2
)
```

### 5. Interactive Mode
Query data interactively:
```bash
python main.py interactive
```

Example queries:
- "Who was present at the crime scene based on tower dumps?"
- "Find devices that were present but made no calls"
- "Analyze movement patterns for vehicle detection"
- "Cross-reference tower presence with CDR activity"

## Data Formats

### CDR Data Format
Excel files with columns:
- A PARTY (caller number)
- B PARTY (receiver number)
- DATE, TIME, DURATION
- CALL TYPE (CALL-IN, CALL-OUT, SMS-IN, SMS-OUT)
- CELL ID, IMEI, IMSI
- LATITUDE, LONGITUDE

### IPDR Data Format
Excel files with columns:
- Mobile Number
- Source/Destination IP
- URL/Domain
- Upload/Download Volume
- Session Duration
- Protocol, Port

### Tower Dump Format
CSV/Excel files with columns:
- Mobile Number
- IMEI, IMSI
- Tower ID
- Tower Latitude/Longitude
- Timestamp
- Call Type

## Risk Indicators

### Integrated Risk Assessment
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: Present at crime scene + encrypted comms + device switching
- ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH**: Multiple risk factors across data sources
- ðŸŸ¢ **MEDIUM**: Some suspicious patterns
- âšª **LOW**: Normal behavior patterns

### Pattern Detection
1. **Physical Presence**: Crime scene presence from tower dumps
2. **Device Manipulation**: IMEI/IMSI changes, SIM swapping
3. **Communication Evasion**: Silent periods, encrypted apps
4. **Movement Patterns**: Vehicle use, impossible travel
5. **Network Coordination**: Group movements, synchronized activity

## Key Use Cases

### 1. Crime Scene Investigation
```python
# Identify all suspects at crime scene
result = agent.analyze_crime_scene(
    crime_location="Bank Branch",
    crime_time="2024-01-15 14:30:00"
)
```

### 2. Suspect Tracking
```python
# Track complete journey
journey = agent.track_suspect_journey(
    suspect="9876543210",
    date="2024-01-15"
)
```

### 3. Network Mapping
```python
# Find all connections
network = agent.find_network_connections("9876543210")
```

### 4. Surveillance Detection
```python
# Detect evasion techniques
evasion = agent.detect_surveillance_evasion()
```

## Output Examples
