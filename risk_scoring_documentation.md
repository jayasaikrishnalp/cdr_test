# CDR Intelligence Agent - Risk Scoring Documentation

## Overview
This document provides detailed documentation of the risk scoring algorithm used in the CDR Intelligence Agent to classify suspects into risk categories based on their communication patterns and behaviors.

## Risk Scoring Components

### 1. Device Risk (0-25 points)
Evaluates device-related anomalies indicating criminal behavior.

| Pattern | Points | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| 3+ IMEIs | 25 | Multiple burner phones, strong criminal indicator |
| 2 IMEIs | 25 | Device switching/SIM swapping, moderate criminal indicator |
| SIM swapping detected | 10 | Potential identity obfuscation |
| Normal (1 IMEI) | 0 | Standard behavior |

**Criminal Significance**: 
- Multiple IMEIs indicate use of burner phones
- Common in drug trafficking, organized crime
- Used to avoid surveillance and tracking

### 2. Temporal Risk (0-25 points)
Analyzes time-based patterns suggesting covert operations.

| Pattern | Points | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| >4% odd hour calls | 20 | Very high covert activity (midnight-5AM) |
| 2-4% odd hour calls | 15 | Significant covert activity |
| 1-2% odd hour calls | 10 | Elevated late-night activity |
| >3 call bursts | +5 | Rapid coordination patterns |

**Criminal Significance**:
- Midnight-5AM calls indicate secretive operations
- Call bursts suggest urgent coordination
- Common in drug deals, criminal planning

### 3. Communication Risk (0-25 points)
Examines communication behavior anomalies.

| Pattern | Points | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| 100% voice (no SMS) | 20 | Avoiding traceable text communications |
| >90% voice calls | 15 | Heavy voice preference |
| Repeated call durations | +5 | Possible coded communication |
| Circular loops detected | +5 | Organized network structure |
| One-ring signaling | +5 | Covert signaling behavior |

**Criminal Significance**:
- Voice-only avoids written evidence
- Repeated durations suggest coded messages
- Circular loops indicate organized hierarchy

### 4. Frequency Risk (0-15 points)
Evaluates call frequency patterns.

| Pattern | Points | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| >3 high-freq contacts | 15 | Intensive communication network |
| 1-3 high-freq contacts | 10 | Moderate network activity |
| Dominant contact (>30%) | +5 | Potential handler relationship |

**Criminal Significance**:
- High frequency indicates active operations
- Dominant contacts suggest handler-operative relationships

### 5. Network Risk (0-10 points)
Assesses network connections and relationships.

| Pattern | Points | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Direct suspect connections | 10 | Inter-criminal communication |
| 3+ common contacts | 5 | Shared network members |
| Synchronized calling | +5 | Coordinated operations |

**Criminal Significance**:
- Direct connections reveal criminal networks
- Common contacts indicate shared operations
- Synchronized activity suggests coordination

## Risk Level Thresholds

### Total Score Calculation
```
Total Risk Score = Device Risk + Temporal Risk + Communication Risk + Frequency Risk + Network Risk
Maximum Possible Score = 100 points
```

### Risk Categories

| Risk Level | Score Range | Emoji | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| CRITICAL | 70-100 | ðŸ”´ | Immediate investigation required |
| HIGH | 50-69 | ðŸ”´ | High priority investigation |
| MEDIUM | 30-49 | ðŸŸ¡ | Moderate concern, monitor closely |
| LOW | 0-29 | ðŸŸ¢ | Low concern, routine monitoring |

### Special Override Rules

1. **Device Switching Override**: 
   - Anyone with 2+ IMEIs is automatically elevated to MEDIUM risk minimum
   - Rationale: Device switching is a fundamental criminal behavior

2. **Voice-Only Override**:
   - 100% voice communication with 10+ calls triggers automatic review
   - Rationale: Complete avoidance of SMS is highly suspicious

## Detailed Risk Decision Examples

### Example 1: Peer basha (HIGH RISK)
```
Device Risk: 25 points (2 IMEIs)
Temporal Risk: 20 points (13.4% odd hours)
Communication Risk: 5 points (high voice %)
Frequency Risk: 10 points (multiple high-freq contacts)
Network Risk: 5 points (common contacts)
-----------------------------------------
Total Score: 65 points = HIGH RISK ðŸ”´
```

### Example 2: Ali (MEDIUM RISK - Corrected)
```
Device Risk: 25 points (2 IMEIs)
Temporal Risk: 0 points (low odd hours)
Communication Risk: 0 points (mixed voice/SMS)
Frequency Risk: 10 points (high frequency patterns)
Network Risk: 0 points (no direct connections)
-----------------------------------------
Total Score: 35 points = MEDIUM RISK ðŸŸ¡
Note: Even if score was <30, override rule applies due to 2 IMEIs
```

### Example 3: Danial Srikakulam (MEDIUM RISK)
```
Device Risk: 0 points (1 IMEI)
Temporal Risk: 15 points (4.5% odd hours)
Communication Risk: 20 points (100% voice)
Frequency Risk: 5 points (moderate patterns)
Network Risk: 5 points (common contacts)
-----------------------------------------
Total Score: 45 points = MEDIUM RISK ðŸŸ¡
```

### Example 4: Varshith (LOW RISK)
```
Device Risk: 0 points (1 IMEI)
Temporal Risk: 5 points (minimal odd hours)
Communication Risk: 10 points (high voice %)
Frequency Risk: 10 points (high frequency)
Network Risk: 0 points (isolated)
-----------------------------------------
Total Score: 25 points = LOW RISK ðŸŸ¢
```

## Criminal Pattern Weights

The system uses weighted scoring based on law enforcement insights:

1. **Device Switching (40% weight)**: Most reliable indicator
2. **Odd Hours (25% weight)**: Strong covert operation signal
3. **Voice Only (20% weight)**: Evidence avoidance behavior
4. **High Frequency (15% weight)**: Active criminal operations

## Investigation Priority Matrix

| Risk Level | Device Anomaly | Temporal Anomaly | Action Required |
|------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| CRITICAL | Multiple devices | High odd hours | Immediate surveillance |
| HIGH | Device switching | Moderate odd hours | Priority investigation |
| MEDIUM | Any anomaly | Any anomaly | Enhanced monitoring |
| LOW | None | Minimal | Routine checks |

## Risk Score Interpretation Guide

### CRITICAL Risk (70-100 points)
- **Profile**: Professional criminals, organized crime
- **Indicators**: 3+ IMEIs, extensive odd hours, complex networks
- **Action**: Immediate investigation, possible surveillance warrant

### HIGH Risk (50-69 points)
- **Profile**: Active criminals, drug dealers, handlers
- **Indicators**: Device switching + odd hours + voice-only
- **Action**: Priority investigation, pattern analysis

### MEDIUM Risk (30-49 points)
- **Profile**: Low-level operatives, couriers, associates
- **Indicators**: One major anomaly (devices OR timing OR communication)
- **Action**: Regular monitoring, watch for escalation

### LOW Risk (0-29 points)
- **Profile**: Minimal suspicious activity
- **Indicators**: Normal patterns with minor anomalies
- **Action**: Routine monitoring only

## Advanced Pattern Scoring (Phase 1 Additions)
