|---------|--------|-------------------|------------|
| 3+ suspects synchronized | +5 | Coordinated operations | HIGH |
| 2 suspects synchronized | +3 | Paired activity | MEDIUM |
| No synchronization | 0 | Independent operations | LOW |

---

## 6. Location Anomalies (Phase 1 - Separate Tool)

Location anomalies don't add to the base risk score but can trigger automatic HIGH risk flags:

| Pattern | Action | Detection Criteria | Risk Level |
|---------|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Impossible travel | Auto HIGH flag | >200 km/h speed | HIGH |
| Border activity | +10 to total | Within 50km of border | HIGH |
| Location clustering | Risk indicator | 5+ calls from same spot | MEDIUM |
| Wide area operations | Risk indicator | High location variance | MEDIUM |

---

## Risk Score Calculation Formula

```
Total Risk Score = Device Risk + Temporal Risk + Communication Risk + Frequency Risk + Network Risk

Where:
- Device Risk: 0-25 points
- Temporal Risk: 0-25 points (base + bursts + silent periods)
- Communication Risk: 0-25 points (voice/SMS + patterns)
- Frequency Risk: 0-15 points
- Network Risk: 0-10 points (connections + common + sync)

Maximum Possible: 100 points
```

## Risk Level Thresholds

| Score Range | Risk Level | Emoji | Action Required |
|-------------|------------|-------|-----------------|
| 70-100 | CRITICAL | ðŸ”´ | Immediate investigation |
| 50-69 | HIGH | ðŸ”´ | Priority investigation |
| 30-49 | MEDIUM | ðŸŸ¡ | Enhanced monitoring |
| 0-29 | LOW | ðŸŸ¢ | Routine monitoring |

## Override Rules

1. **Device Override**: 2+ IMEIs = Automatic MEDIUM minimum
2. **Voice-Only Override**: 100% voice with 10+ calls = Automatic review
3. **Location Override**: Impossible travel = Automatic HIGH flag

---

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Peer basha (HIGH RISK - 65 points)
```
Device Risk: 25 points (2 IMEIs)
Temporal Risk: 20 points (13.4% odd hours)
Communication Risk: 5 points (high voice %)
Frequency Risk: 10 points (2 high-freq contacts)
Network Risk: 5 points (common contacts)
Total: 65/100 = HIGH RISK ðŸ”´
```

### Example 2: Ali (MEDIUM RISK - 35 points)
```
Device Risk: 25 points (2 IMEIs)
Temporal Risk: 0 points
Communication Risk: 0 points
Frequency Risk: 10 points (1 high-freq contact)
Network Risk: 0 points
Total: 35/100 = MEDIUM ðŸŸ¡ (Override applied)
```

### Example 3: Danial (MEDIUM RISK - 45 points)
```
Device Risk: 0 points (1 IMEI)
Temporal Risk: 15 points (4.5% odd hours)
Communication Risk: 20 points (100% voice)
Frequency Risk: 5 points
Network Risk: 5 points (4 common contacts)
Total: 45/100 = MEDIUM ðŸŸ¡
```

2. **One-Ring Signaling**: +5 points to Communication Risk
3. **Silent Periods**: +3-5 points to Temporal Risk
4. **Synchronized Calling**: +3-5 points to Network Risk
5. **Location Analysis**: Separate tool with override capabilities

### Impact on Scoring
- Maximum Communication Risk increased potential

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2-4)

### Planned Anomaly Additions
1. **Ghost Numbers** (+10 points): Calls to non-existent numbers
2. **Conference Calls** (+5 points): Multi-party coordination
3. **Financial Patterns** (+15 points): 48-hour payment cycles
4. **Encrypted App Signals** (+10 points): WhatsApp/Telegram indicators
5. **International Red Zones** (+20 points): Calls to high-risk countries

### Machine Learning Enhancement
- Dynamic point adjustment based on confirmed cases
- Pattern combination scoring
- Regional variation adaptation
- Temporal pattern learning

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Point Stacking**: Multiple patterns in same category stack (e.g., voice-only + circular loops)
2. **Maximum Caps**: Each category has maximum possible points
3. **Override Priority**: Override rules supersede calculated scores
4. **Evidence Weight**: Higher points = stronger evidence for investigation

This point distribution system ensures balanced, evidence-based risk assessment for criminal intelligence analysis.
