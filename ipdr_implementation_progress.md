## Key Features Implemented

### IPDR Data Processing
- Automatic app detection based on port signatures
- Temporal feature extraction (odd hours, day patterns)
- Data volume analysis and anomaly detection
- Support for multiple file formats

### Encryption Analysis
- Identifies encrypted communication apps
- Calculates encryption risk scores
- Detects suspicious encryption patterns
- Provides investigation recommendations

### Data Pattern Analysis
- Detects large file transfers (>10MB)
- Identifies pattern day concentrations
- Finds data usage spikes
- Analyzes upload/download ratios

## Usage Examples (When Complete)

```bash
# IPDR-only analysis
python main.py ipdr-analyze

# Specific suspect IPDR analysis
python main.py ipdr-analyze -s "Peer basha"

# Integrated CDR+IPDR analysis
python main.py integrated-analyze

# Correlation analysis
python main.py correlate --time-window 5
```

## Integration Benefits

1. **Enhanced Detection**: Combines CDR behavioral patterns with IPDR digital footprints
2. **Correlation Insights**: Identifies voice call â†’ encrypted message patterns
3. **Evidence Strength**: Multiple data sources provide stronger case evidence
4. **Pattern Validation**: Cross-validates suspicious behaviors

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining IPDR analysis tools
2. Build the main IPDR agent class
3. Implement correlation engine
4. Create integrated agent
5. Update CLI with new commands
6. Create test data and documentation

## Architecture Benefits

- **Modular Design**: CDR and IPDR agents work independently
- **Flexible Analysis**: Can analyze either or both data types
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new data sources (bank records, etc.)
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns

This implementation provides law enforcement with powerful tools to analyze digital communications and correlate them with traditional call records for comprehensive criminal intelligence.
